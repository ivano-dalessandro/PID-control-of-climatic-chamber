# PID-control-of-climatic-chamber
In this repository there is the code developed in Mbed Os to control a climatic chamber. Matlab scripts allows to start serial communication with some sensors used. LabView script is used to read data with serial communication and change the PID parameters with a graphic interface. Moreover, there are also all sensors datasheet.
All components used are integrated on a PCB. PBC design is presented in folder "Altium_project".
